<!-- <h3><strong>Sharks and their diet</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Whale Shark</strong>: Primarily feeds on plankton, small
            fish, and tiny marine organisms filtered through its gills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Great White Shark</strong>: Carnivorous predator that feeds
            on fish (like tuna), seals, sea lions, dolphins, and even small
            whales.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tiger Shark</strong>: Known as the "garbage can of the sea"
            because it eats a wide variety of prey, including fish, birds,
            seals, smaller sharks, squid, turtles, and even things like
            discarded trash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bull Shark</strong>: Feeds on fish (including other sharks),
            dolphins, and even terrestrial mammals when near the shoreline, like
            birds and dogs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hammerhead Shark</strong>: Prefers rays, but also consumes
            fish, smaller sharks, squid, and crustaceans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mako Shark</strong>: Predominantly eats bony fishes like
            mackerel, tuna, and bonito. They will also eat squid and smaller
            sharks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blacktip Shark</strong>: Eats smaller fish primarily, like
            sardines, herring, and anchovies, but will also eat crustaceans and
            cephalopods.
          </li>

  <h4><em>Speed</em></h4>
  <p>
    In general, sharks swim ("cruise") at an average speed of 8 kilometres per
    hour (5.0 mph), but when feeding or attacking, the average shark can reach
    speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour (12 mph). The shortfin mako shark,
    the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish, can burst at speeds up to 50
    kilometres per hour (31 mph).[85] The great white shark is also capable of
    speed bursts. These exceptions may be due to the warm-blooded, or
    homeothermic, nature of these sharks' physiology. Sharks can travel 70 to 80
    km in a day.[86]
  </p>
  <h4><em>Intelligence</em></h4>
  <p>
    Sharks possess brain-to-body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and
    birds,[87] and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling
    play in the wild.[88][89] There is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can
    use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their
    environment.[90]
  </p>
  <h4><em>Sleep</em></h4>
  <p>
    All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to
    breathe; however, not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that
    are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to
    force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from
    the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this
    state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them[91]
    and as such they are not truly asleep. Species that do need to swim
    continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in
    which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments
    conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain,
    coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping,
    and this also may be the case in larger shark species.[91] In 2016 a great
    white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers
    believed was sleep swimming.[92]
