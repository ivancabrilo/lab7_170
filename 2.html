    <h2>Shark sizes</h2>

    <p>
      Sharks range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus
      perryi), a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in
      length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the
      world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length.[2] They
      are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 metres (6,600
      ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few
      known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can be
      found in both seawater and freshwater.[3] Sharks have a covering of dermal
      denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition
      to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable
      teeth.[4]

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      The etymology of the word shark is uncertain, the most likely etymology
      states that the original sense of the word was that of "predator, one who
      preys on others" from the Dutch schurk, meaning 'villain, scoundrel' (cf.
      card shark, loan shark, etc.), which was later applied to the fish due to
      its predatory behaviour.[8]

      The oldest total-group chondrichthyans, known as acanthodians or "spiny
      sharks", appeared during the Early Silurian, around 439 million years
      ago.[11] The oldest confirmed members of Elasmobranchii sensu lato (the
      group containing all cartilaginous fish more closely related to modern
      sharks and rays than to chimaeras) appeared during the Devonian.[12] The
      oldest representatives of Neoselachii, the group containing modern sharks
      (Selachii) and rays (Batoidea) to the exclusion of most extinct
      elasmobranch groups, date to the Permian.[13][14] Selachiimorpha and
      Batoidea are suggested to have diverged during the Triassic.[15] The
      oldest modern sharks date to the Early Jurassic, with most modern orders
      appearing by the end of the Jurassic.[16] Selachians largely replaced the
      hybodonts, which had previously been dominant group of shark-like fish
      during the Triassic and Early Jurassic.[17]

      Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark
      populations are threatened by human activities. Since 1970, shark
      populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing.[5]

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      The classic view describes a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in search
      of food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live far more
      social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely to have their own
      distinct personalities.[82] Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at
      rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a
      year.[83] Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds,
      with many sharks covering entire ocean basins. Sharks can be highly
      social, remaining in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped
      hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of
      California.[37] Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example,
      oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during
      feeding.[70] When approached too closely some sharks perform a threat
      display. This usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements, and can
      vary in intensity according to the threat level.[84]
